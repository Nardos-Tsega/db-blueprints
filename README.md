# Database Design Blueprints

## Overview
Welcome to my db blueprints! This repository is a collection of case studies where I design database schemas for real-world platforms like LinkedIn, Facebook, and others. The goal is to share my process and share insights into the principles and best practices of database design.

## Why This Repository Exists
- **Learn by Doing**: Hands-on design of real-world systems to deepen my understanding of databases.
- **Share Knowledge**: Provide a resource for others to learn database design concepts.
- **Collaborate**: Open the door for feedback and contributions from the developer community.
